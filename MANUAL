Thank you for using SolXd, the crystallographic files (*.ins, *.res, *.cif) 
indexing tool. Before you start, you need to define the location of indexing 
folder(s), a folder where to keep the database file etc. "Seetings" button 
should be the first button you press at the first start. When you are done 
with the configuration, you can index your files. It may take some time. After 
the indexing, you will see all files as a list. Normal files without anny 
problem will be marked as a black color. Other colors indicate different 
problem. You can eximine them using external text editor (should be defined 
vis "Settings" menu) or external file viewer. You can also delete all this 
files dirrectly from database. Just select one or many files (hold Ctrl for 
mutiple file selection), then select delete file(s) via context menu. A 
conformation dialog will show-up.
