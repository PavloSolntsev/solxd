Features that should be added:
    - Ability to index files from FTP and possibly SSH remote resource.
    - Support for passive and active FTP modes.
    - Dynamic list of files to index.
    - The database file should be read only on the same computer where it was created.
    - Secure SolXd by a password. It means, only administrator can create the database.
    - Develop internal viewer to view crystal structures.
    - Parsing of different file: *.p4p, *.pdb.
    - Represent all items as a tree list. That is, combine all files with the same path, base name and unit cell
      into one item.
